# Look-Ma--I-Made-A-Weather-App
Weather App - Final Project - She Codes Plus
App Hosted on Netlify: https://gilded-haupia-af4d40.netlify.app/

## How I worked on this project: The workshop goal was to build a weather app from scratch using a professional development workflow / environment.
- Original App Design: https://megannewman844311.invisionapp.com/freehand/Newman-Weather-Wireframe-iW2hgElCH?dsid_h=8241bbf477416caeb2a32b3b52adfe6fdf388430bf6e75988fbb572ea78348e9&uid_h=7079f7d999917a54f3b9838f409dae60c3896acfb7ed3f10f3bc1d90c42568ee
- I completed tasks in the following manner: 
  --> Mock-up
  --> UI Development of basic HTML / CSS
  --> Feature: City Search Form
  --> Feature: Display Time / Date
  --> Feature: Add Search Engine
  --> Feature: Link Search Engine to display name of city in search form
  --> Feature: Integrate API OpenWeather API to gather temperature data for city in search form, display temperature once API is called
  --> Feature: Add data for humidity, wind speed and weather conditions per API call
  --> Feature: Add weather icons based on API call
  --> Feature: Add 5 day weather forecast

## How to navigate this project
- The application displays data from the API in the form of current date and time of your current location using google API 
- Responsive form to search for weather in 200,000+ cities across the globe
- The application fetches data from the OpenWeather API
- The application displays data for the searched city and a 5-day weather forcecast

## Why I built the project this way
- Since I've only done workshop based development and am otherwise self-taught, I'm used to following fairly rigid workflows that are set to me. This project was my first full scale web application build from mockup to production.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually but I've only taken workshops that focus on the frontend, which meant we used an existing API. I have limited backend knowledge but I would love to have a way to track which cities are being searched for in this app.

## If I had more time I would change this
- Figure out a way to integrate the backend to track the data
- Refactor some of the code. Especially this part [link to code on GitHub]
